How to ban classes?
===================

I love catching problems at http://velo.github.io/tag/compile-check/[compile time].

This week I came across an odd situation.  I need to make sure nobody was using 'javax.ws.rs.Path' class.

So how can I ban a give class from my project?

It looked like a job for maven enforcer plugin!  Nop, that was no good. There is no https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/[enforcer rules] for this. May be http://www.mojohaus.org/extra-enforcer-rules/[extra enforcer rules]?  No rule there as well.

After searching a little bit more I found a plugin to do that!

Restrict-maven-plugin allowed me to do so.

```
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.yamanyar</groupId>
  <artifactId>restrict-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>0.6</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <phase>process-classes</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>restrict</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
  <configuration>
    <continueOnError>false</continueOnError>
    <restrictions>
      <restriction>com.contaazul.* to javax.ws.rs.Path</restriction>
    </restrictions>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

Easy no?

Now if someone add this by mistake maven will let us know:
```
[error] Restricted access from:(com.contaazul.MyClass.class) com.contaazul.MyClass to: javax.ws.rs.Path due to rule [1-1]

Way better then catching a bug latter, no?
