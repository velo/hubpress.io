Giving JUnit something like TestNG.@BeforeSuite
===============================================


JUnit is the http://blog.takipi.com/we-analyzed-60678-libraries-on-github-here-are-the-top-100/[Undisputed King] of Java unit test Libraries.

TestNG has a way more compreensive lifecycle management using @Before/@After annotations. If you wanna know more, there is a good presentation https://prezi.com/zcv2mk3spo93/testng/[about testNG on prezi].  Slide 22 shows how @Before/After works.

For me, http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#annotations[`@BeforeSuite`] is pretty much essential writting integrations test.

`@BeforeSuite`: "the annotated method will be run before all tests in this suite have run."

And you can't do that with JUnit!

People that do not understand what `@BeforeSuite` does suggests using `@BeforeClass`.  Well, guess what, it ain't the same.

The closest JUnit can get to @BeforeSuite is having a http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8435322/is-there-a-equivalent-of-testngs-beforesuite-in-junit-4[TestSuite annotated with @BeforeClass], but that means you need to manually keep track of your tests:
```
@RunWith(MySuite.class)
@SuiteClasses({FooTest.class, BarTest.class, BazTest.class});
```

Serious? 2016! For each new test, you need to "remember" to update this.  NO WAY!  This is so freaking insane!


===== A better way

So, what alternative can I offer? http://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.12/org/junit/ClassRule.html[@ClassRule] + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern[singleton].

Yeah, I openned the laptop to suggest people: use a singleton.

Well, pick your poison, manual, error prone Suite or shameful singleton.

===== Example

On each test, I included my @RuleClass, pointing to a singleton:
```
public class Test[12] {

    @ClassRule
    public static SuiteRule rule = SuiteRule.INSTANCE;

    @Test
    public void setup() {
        System.out.println("Test[12]");
    }

}
```

And the rule would be something like this:
```
    public static final SuiteRule INSTANCE = new SuiteRule();

    private final AtomicBoolean initialized = new AtomicBoolean();

    @Override
    public Statement apply(Statement base, Description description) {
        if (!initialized.get()) {
            beforeSuite(description);
            initialized.set(true);
        }

        return base;
    }

    protected void beforeSuite(Description description) {
        System.out.println("Before suite");
    }
```

Running this example printed this:
```
Before suite
Test1
Test2
```


No rocket science, quite the oposite, a very trivial piece of code, using design patterns that I don't even like, but since I saw so many people asking for it and no good answer, I decided to document a better alternative.
