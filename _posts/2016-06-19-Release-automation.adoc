Release automation
==================

:hp-tags: reuse, automation


Which is faster: pushing a new release to maven central OR bloging about release automation?

Well, I can't write about it under 2 minutes =D


##### Who is rultor?

https://github.com/rultor[@rultor] is a bot that automates routine operation on github repositories.  It can automate pull request merges, deploy and release (which is the one I'm presenting here).

Rultor is https://github.com/yegor256/rultor[opensource] and written in java.


##### How does it work?

Rultor has it's own yml file, where you add the steps towards a release.

https://github.com/velo/boilerplate.maven/blob/master/.rultor.yml[For instance]:
```
release:
  script:
    - mvn versions:set "-DnewVersion=${tag}"
    - git commit -am "${tag}"
    - mvn deploy -Pci -B -Prelease --settings ../settings.xml -Dgpg.homedir=..
```

For most of my opensource activity I need only 3 steps:

* Update pom's version
* commit change
* run maven deploy

The https://github.com/velo/boilerplate.maven/blob/master/pom.xml#L341[release] profile will take care of generating sources and javadoc files, sign everything with gpg, stage artifacts at sonatype and release staged artifacts.

##### assets

Wait a minute, staging requires passwords and gpg your private keys, where this all come from?

True, all that is manage on rultor.yml https://github.com/velo/boilerplate.maven/blob/master/.rultor.yml#L20[assets section].

```
assets:
  secring.gpg: velo/.assets#maven/secring.gpg
  settings.xml: velo/.assets#maven/settings.xml
  pubring.gpg: velo/.assets#maven/pubring.gpg
```

This instructs rultor to download this files from my private .assets repository.

##### Releasing

To release, just create a new https://github.com/velo/maven-formatter-plugin/issues/13[issue] with:
```
@rultor release, tag=`1.6.0`
```

If everything goes ok rultor will create a https://github.com/velo/maven-formatter-plugin/releases/tag/1.6.0[tag] with that release as well.


One last tip, since this rultor, travis, maven and all other commonly used tool code boilerplate is repetitive, I created a https://github.com/velo/boilerplate.maven[boilerplate project for maven].  

It may or may not be a good idea for you to have one as well.
